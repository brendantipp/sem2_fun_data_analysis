### Four tasks are contained in on Jupyter Notebook named tasks

## Task 1

##### Task Description
Within the Jupyter notebook write a python function called counts that takes a list as an input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the last as keys and the number of times each item appears as values.


#### Devlopment plan

- Write fucntion counts in Python using Jupyter notebook 
- Function will require an input list and an output dictionary
- Function will require a count of each of input (using inbuilt python fuction .count)
- Create a for loop to loop thruogh each list value/keyand create a dict with a key and value(the count)
- Possibly require a sort function TBC
- Wrap loop in function named counts

#### counts function code 

        # create the required list
         list = ['A', 'A','B', 'C','A']
         
         # create an empty dictionary
        dict = {}




#### How to run and test/view

The created fucntion counts() can be viewed and tested interactivley using the jupyter notebook tasks.ipynb
